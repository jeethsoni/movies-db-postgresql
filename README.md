 ### **Description**

 Honestly, Boredom and curiousity took over me. I got a little bored doing the mySQL stuff again and again. I was curious to how other databases work and are the scripts different from each other? So I picked up PostgreSQL and it was really fun. I learned a lot and realized that databases are not that different from each other. I worked with the movies excel file chopped it up using normilization and built the database.

 ### **Conclusion**

 This was a fun little project. I needed the change and I got to learn something new. I also used Triggers to randomly input movie reviews after insert on movie table. 

 Happy Fourth :)
